"Ethernet AP" does not appear supported
"Ethernet" is probably supported but this is ethernet handoff not usually used.

The following interfaces appear to work for this device:
 Wireless AP XXX (where XXX is some number)
 HomePNA1
 HomePNA2

This would mean setting your @interfaces to:
 my @interfaces = ("Wireless AP 193","HomePNA1","HomePNA2");
